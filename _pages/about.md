My name is Nick. I am a family man and a semi-nomadic software engineer and instructor

I've worked with a variety of software projects and clients, including athletics, aeronautics, government, real estate, and once, a housekeeping business.  I've done full-stack development, developed thin and fat clients, and conducted market research.

I am currently enjoying teaching new software engineers at a university level.
